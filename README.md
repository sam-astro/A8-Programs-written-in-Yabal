# MusicalYabal
A music tracker and some other stuff written in Yabal for the Astro-8

### Controls:
`_` (Underscore key) - ***Play/Pause music***

(backspace key) - ***Return to the beginning of track***

`,` (comma key) - ***Decrease speed of music***

`.` (period key) - ***Increase speed of music***

(all arrow keys) - ***Move cursor up down left or right***


### Directions:
Move cursor in any direction and track. then type a letter or number to place a note. writing a 0 will erase a note. Notes are represented as numbers between 0 and 32, but to take up less space in the tracker the numbers after 9 use letters a-v, which is a base 32 number system. These numbers are then converted to frequencies using this chart: https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Architecture/Expansion%20Ports.html#conversion-table
